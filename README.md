# FreeForm-Minesweeper
The game of Minesweeper as you know and love, but now with the ability to play the classic game on any shape of board you can draw!

## How to start
When you open the game, you're met with a pretty blank window. Before you start playing, you have to give yourself a board to play on! Simply click on on blacked out square to turn it on, and click on a square that is turned on to turn it back off again. You can also click and drag to paint squares on or off. If drawing a board isn't your fancy, chose one the 4 classic Minesweeper presets at the top: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert. These board come with their won difficulty setting so you can truly expericence at the click of a button! You can also use the Fill and Clear buttons to turn all on or off, respectively. After you've drawn yourself a board, select a difficulty from 1 to 4, with 1 being a small amount of mines and 4 being a lot of mines. Then just hit the play button at the top to start the game! If you liked the board you've drawn, you can hit the Save button to play with it again later, using the Load Button.

## How to play
Once you've started playing the game, you play it how normal Minesweeper works! Click on a square to reveal it. If it has a number, 1-8, or a blank (0), that's how many of the 8 potential squares around it have a mine in them. If you click on a mine, you lose! Reveal all the squares without mines to win the game! To help you along your way, there are 2 tools at your disposal: flags and chords. If you're pretty certain you've identified where a mine is, right click on the square to mark it with a flag. These flags can't be revealed like other squares, so you can be safe from any dangerous mines lurking beneath. If you have found and flagged all the mines around a square you can double click on it to chord the square. This reveals all the remaining squares. Pretty handy! But be careful, if you chord with incorrect flags you'll reveal a mine and lose! If you wnt to play again with the same board, you can click the smilely face new game button. There's also a button to switch between Revealing Mode and Flagging Mode, next to the reset button. In Revealing Mode you play as normal, but in Flagging Mode all your click will place flags. Don't worry, you can still chord! If you want to play with a different board, hit the Stop button and you can go back to designing a board.
